VRC01-gH knockin mouse germline gene database

The VRC01-gH transgenic mouse expresses the VRC01 inferred germline heavy chain. The transgenic heavy chain is expressed by ~85% of circulating B-cells, with mouse-origin heavy chains making up the other 15%. All light chains are mouse-origin. The germline database contains all mouse germline genes, plus the human germline genes used by VRC01. There is no mouse germline gene that shares the name of the VRC01 V (IGHV1-2*02) or D (IGHD5-5*01), but the mouse database contains an exact name match to the VRC01 J gene (IGHJ2*01). To avoid duplicate names (which are not allowed by some VDJ assigners like BLASTn), we have renamed the VRC01 J gene to IGHJ2*09.
