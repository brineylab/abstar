Homo sapiens germline gene database

A single change was made to the germline sequences downloaded from IMGT/GENE-DB. The germline sequence for IGHV1-2*03 contains a single ambiguous nucleotide (N). All other alleles of this gene contain a G at the position, so the ambiguous nucleotide was changed from N to G. Hopefully IMGT will update this sequence in the near future.
