    Performs quality trimming with sickle.

    Args:

        input_directory (str): Path to a directory of files to be quality
            trimmed. If the directory contains paired reads, they should
            follow the Illumina MiSeq naming scheme. If you have paired reads
            that do not follow the MiSeq naming scheme, you can group the paired
            read files yourself and pass them to ``--file-pairs``.

        output_directory (str): Path to the output directory, into which quality-
            trimmed read files will be deposited. If not provided, a directory
            will be created in the parent directory of ``input_directory``.
            Required if using ``file_pairs`` instead of ``input_directory``.

        quality_cutoff (int): Quality score at which to truncate reads. Default
            is ``20``.

        length_cutoff (int): Reads will be discarded if, after quality trimming,
            the length is shorter than this cutoff. Default is ``50``.

        quality_type (str): Quality score type. Options are ``solexa``, ``illumina``,
            and ``sanger``. ``illumina`` is equivalent to Casava 1.3-1.7 and ``sanger`` is
            Casava >= 1.8. Default is ``sanger``.

        compress_output (bool): If ``True``, output files will be gzip compressed.
            Default is ``True``.

        file_pairs (list): If input files are paired-end reads that don't follow Illumina's
            MiSeq naming scheme, you can pass a list of lists/tuples, with each list/tuple
            containing a pair of read file paths.

        singles_directory (str): Path to singles output directory. If processing paired reads
            and one read of the pair passes quality/length filters and the other doesn't,
            the single passing read will be written to this file. Default is ``None``, which
            results in the single sequences being discarded and not written to file.

        nextseq (bool): Set to ``True`` if the sequencing data comes from a NextSeq run. The
            file naming scheme for NextSeq runs is different that MiSeq runs, and setting
            this option will allow NextSeq paired read files to be processed appropriately.
            Default is ``False``.

        paired_reads (bool): If ``True``, reads will be processed as paired reads. If ``False``,
            each read will be processed separately. It is not advisable to process paired
            reads with ``paired_reads`` set to ``False`` because if paired read files are
            processed separately and one read passes filters while the paired read doesn't,
            this may cause problems with downstream processes (like read merging).

        allow_5prime_trimming (bool): If ``True``, quality trimming will be performed
            on the 5' end of the reads as well as the 3' end. Default is ``False``.
