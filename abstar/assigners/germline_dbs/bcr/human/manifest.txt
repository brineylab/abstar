A few changes were made to the germline sequences downloaded from IMGT. 
  - IGHV1-2*03 contains an ambiguous nucleotide. All other alleles of this gene encode a G at the position, so the ambiguous nucleotide was changed to G.
  - IGHV1-45*01 contains an ambiguous nucleotide. All other alleles of this gene encode a T at this position, so the ambiguous nucleotide was changed to T.
  - IGHV4-30-4*05 contains an ambiguous nucleotide. All other alleles of this gene encode a C at this position, so the ambiguous nucleotide was changed to C.
  - IGHV4-59*09 contains several ambiguous nucleotides and was removed.
  - IGHV1-NL1*01 contained an ambiguous nucleotide and was removed.
